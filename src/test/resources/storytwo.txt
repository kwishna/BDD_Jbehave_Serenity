!-- Scenario:  A scenario is a collection of executable steps of different type
!-- 
!-- Given step represents a precondition to an event
!-- When step represents the occurrence of the event
!-- Then step represents the outcome of the event
!-- 
!-- Scenario:  Another scenario exploring different combination of events
!-- 
!-- Given a [precondition]
!-- When a negative event occurs
!-- Then a the outcome should [be-captured]
!-- 
!-- Examples:
!-- |precondition|be-captured|
!-- |abc|be captured    |
!-- |xyz|not be captured|
